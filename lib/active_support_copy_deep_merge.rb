class Hash
  # Returns a new hash with +self+ and +other_hash+ merged recursively.
  #
  #   h1 = { a: true, b: { c: [1, 2, 3] } }
  #   h2 = { a: false, b: { x: [3, 4, 5] } }
  #
  #   h1.deep_merge(h2) # => { a: false, b: { c: [1, 2, 3], x: [3, 4, 5] } }
  #
  # Like with Hash#merge in the standard library, a block can be provided
  # to merge values:
  #
  #   h1 = { a: 100, b: 200, c: { c1: 100 } }
  #   h2 = { b: 250, c: { c1: 200 } }
  #   h1.deep_merge(h2) { |key, this_val, other_val| this_val + other_val }
  #   # => { a: 100, b: 450, c: { c1: 300 } }
