# Reference dataset

The reference dataset helps understand the features from the COA engine and
serves as a unique source of truth for the tests and the documentation
(although it is still in concurrence with fixtures for spec/scripts/generate-depls)

## Hello World

The first kind of example that is exhibited here is a "hello world". It
contains just over the bare minimum to make the COA works and generate
pipelines.
