default:
  #bosh-options: # Optional. You may override bosh deploy default options for all deployments. To customize only a specific deployment, see 'deployment-dependencies.yml'
    # cleanup: true # Optional. An boolean that specifies if a bosh cleanup should be run after deployment. Defaults to true.
    # no_redact: false # Optional. Removes redacted from Bosh output. Defaults to false.
    # dry_run: false # Optional. Shows the deployment diff without running a deploy. Defaults to false.
    # fix: false # Optional. Recreate an instance with an unresponsive agent instead of erroring. Defaults to false.
    # max_in_flight: # Optional. A number of max in flight option. Default: unset, use bosh max in flight

    # You can limit job execution per pipeline, static jobs are not affected by this restriction. Only jobs that are
    #  added or removed are limited. You can defined the maximum number of jobs executed in parallel.

    # when parallel execution limit is active, you can choose the placement strategy used to group jobs.
    #   - SerialGroupRoundRobinNamingStrategy: each job is dispatched to a dedicated pool using round-robin strategy. We
    #           have a non deterministic allocation, but good repartition.
    #   - SerialGroupMd5NamingStrategy: each job is dispatched to a dedicated pool using md5 hash and some computation.
    #           we have a deterministic allocation, but repartition cannot be guarantied. Recommended for on-demand services
