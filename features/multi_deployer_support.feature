Feature: Multi deployer support
  In order to create a deployment targeting multiple deployer (ie: bosh, terraform, concourse-pipeline, etc...)
  As a paas-template user,
  I want to know mechanisms provided by COA

  Background:
    Given Hello world generated pipelines from reference_dataset

  Scenario: a deployment, or a part,  is done using Bosh
    But needs documentation

  Scenario: a deployment, or a part, is done using Terraform
     But NYI

  Scenario: a deployment, or a part, is done using a concourse pipeline
    But needs documentation
