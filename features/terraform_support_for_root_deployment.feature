Feature: Terraform support for root deployment
  In order to share a terraform across a root deployment
  As a paas-template user,
  I want to know mechanisms provided by COA

  Background:
    Given Hello world generated pipelines from reference_dataset

  Scenario: a deployment, or a part, is done using a concourse pipeline
    But needs documentation
