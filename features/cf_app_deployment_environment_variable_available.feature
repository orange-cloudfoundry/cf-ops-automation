Feature: Cf application deployment support
  In order to know how to deploy a CF application
  As a paas-template user,
  I want to know which environment varaiables are availlable

  Background:
    Given Hello world generated pipelines from reference_dataset

  Scenario: a deployment, or a part, is done using a concourse pipeline
    But needs documentation
    Then the following environment variables exist:
      | name              | description                                                                     |
      | GENERATE_DIR      | directory holding generated files. It's an absolute path.                       |
      | BASE_TEMPLATE_DIR | directory where `pre-cf-push.sh` is located. It's an relative path.             |
      | SECRETS_DIR       | directory holding secrets related to current deployment. It's an relative path. |
      | CF_API_URL        | current application Cloud Foundry API url                                       |
      | CF_USERNAME       | current Cloud Foundry application user                                          |
      | CF_PASSWORD       | current Cloud Foundry application user password                                 |
      | CF_ORG            | current Cloud Foundry application organization                                  |
      | CF_SPACE          | current Cloud Foundry application space                                         |
      | CUSTOM_SCRIPT_DIR | TODO                                         |
      | CF_MANIFEST       | TODO                                         |
