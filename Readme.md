# cf-ops-automation

This repo contains automation for managing cloudfoundry and services used by Orange CF SKC. 

It provides:
- concourse-based continuous deployment pipeline generator for common resource types: bosh deployments, cf apps, terraform resources
- templating engine supporting operations of multiple environments (e.g. preprod/prod-region1/prod-region2) 

The goal is to automate most (if not all) interactive operations of Bosh, CF API, Iaas APIs, while keeping volume of concourse boilerplate code low, and limit concourse learning prereqs before contributing to automation.

# Overview

This repo takes templates and instances as input, and generates concourse pipelines that automatically reload and execute. As a result, resources gets provisionned and operated:
* Templates are specified in a git repo (referred to as "paas-templates"). It contains a hierarchical structure with root deployment and nested deployment templates.
* Instances are specified in a git repo (referred to as "secrets"). Their structure mimics the template structure, indicating which deployment template should instanciated. See  
* Generated pipeline triggers provisionning of resources whose credentials and secrets are pushed into a git repo (referred to as "secrets"). Plan is to move credentials to credhub.
 
A `root deployment` contains infrastructure to operate `nested deployment`s. 
* A root deployment typically contains Iaas prereqs, Bosh director and its cloud-config, DNS infrastrucure, private git server, Concourse, log collection, monitoring/alerting, credhub, etc... 
* Nested deployments are resources created by a root deployment. This typically include cloudfoundry, admin-ui, services, ... 


## Orange CF-SKC Deployment topology

This repo is maintained by the Orange CF skill center team for its deployments. The team's infrastructure deployment topology and bootstrapping process is illustred below:    
![Overview of pipeline generation for bosh deployments](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/master/docs/overview.puml?lastRefreshOn=17082017).

Source is in the [plantuml](http://plantuml.com/) file: [bosh overview](docs/overview.puml), see [caching tips](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32203610/how-to-integrate-uml-diagrams-into-gitlab-or-github)

The `inception`, `micro-depls`, `master-depls`, `ops-depls`, `expe-depls` are `root deployment`s in Orange CF skill center infrastructure.

The nested deployment model enables a split of responsibility as the operations team scales.

The plan is to open source the Orange's CF skill center team template git repo in the future (once the remaining secrets get cleaned up).

## Script lifecycle overview

The diagram below illustrates the concourse pipeline generation for 2 types of supported resources (Bosh deployments and CF apps). The diagram includes the main hooks that templating engine supports during the resources life cycle.

## Concourse pipeline generation

This section details the format supported by the templating engine in both the template repo and the secrets repo. 

### Bosh deployment resources template format

For each boshrelease, when an `enable-deployment.yml` file is found in the secrets repo, it is going to spruce all template files in the corresponding template repo dir (template files need to end with ```-tpl.yml``` extension).

If a template directory contains hook scripts with specific name, then these scripts get executed in the following order :

  1: `post-generate.sh`: can execute shell operation or spruce task.
     **Restrictions**: as the post-generation script is executed in the same docker image running spruce, no spiff is available.

  2: `pre-bosh-deploy.sh`: can execute shell operation or spiff task. 

  3: `post-bosh-deploy.sh`: can execute shell operation (including curl). 

* to generate an additional errand step, in a `deployment-dependencies.yml` file, insert a key ```errands``` with a subkey named like the errand job to execute 
  

### git submodules
By default, git submodules are not checked out (this can be very time consuming). But some bosh releases require these 
  submodule. There is a mechanism to detect submodule for a release and include it only for this bosh release

#### enable deployment format (enable-deployment.yml)
this is expected to be an empty yaml file !

#### deployment dependencies format (deployment-dependencies.yml)

In `deployment-dependencies.yml`, it is possible to: 

- add secrets path to trigger the build:

``` yaml
        resources:
          secrets:
            extented_scan_path: ["ops-depls/cloudfoundry", "...."]
```
        
- choose a bosh cli version. By default, bosh cli v2 is used unless v1 specified in cli_version
        
``` yaml
        deployment:
          micro-bosh:
            cli_version: v1
            stemcells:
                ...
            releases:
                ...
```

Following is a `deployment-dependencies.yml` sample (should be placed in the boshrelease deployment dir):

``` yaml

---
deployment:
  micro-bosh:
    stemcells:
      bosh-openstack-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent:
    releases:
      route-registrar-boshrelease:
        base_location: https://bosh.io/d/github.com/
        repository: cloudfoundry-community/route-registrar-boshrelease    
      shield:
        base_location: https://bosh.io/d/github.com/
        repository: starkandwayne/shield-boshrelease        
      xxx_boshrelease:
        base_location: https://bosh.io/d/github.com/
        repository: xxx/yyyy
    errands:
      smoke_tests:       
```

### Cloudfoundry application resources template format

For each cf-application, when a `enable-cf-app.yml` file is found, it is going to spruce all files in the template dir ending with ```-tpl.yml```

If a template directory contains a `pre-cf-push.sh` file, then this script is run:
    - you are already logged in CF,
    - you have to download your binaries before uploading to CF

#### `enable-cf-app.yml` file format

``` yaml

---
cf-app:
  probe-apps-domains:
    cf_api_url: 
    cf_username: 
    cf_password: 
    cf_organization: 
    cf_space:
``` 

### pipeline auto-update

If a ci_deployments descriptor (i.e. a file called `ci-deployment-overview.yml`) is detected in secrets dir/<depls>, then an
auto-update job is generated.

### terraform

`ci-deployment-overview.yml` may include a `terraform_config` key to generate a terraform  pipeline.The `terraform_config` key
 must include a `state_file_path` key to indicate tfstate file path. It assumes that a spec dir is also included alongside
 the tfstate file.
  
#### file format

``` yaml

---
ci-deployment:
  ops-depls:
    target_name: concourse-ops
    terraform_config:
      state_file_path: ops-depls/tf-config-dir
    pipelines:
      ops-depls-generated:
        config_file: xxxx/pipelines/ops-depls-generated.yml
        vars_files:
        - xxx/pipelines/credentials-ops-depls-pipeline.yml
        - xxx/ops-depls-versions.yml
      ops-depls-cf-apps-generated:
        config_file: xxx/pipelines/ops-depls-cf-apps-generated.yml
        vars_files:
        - xxx/pipelines/credentials-ops-depls-pipeline.yml
        - xxx/ops-depls-versions.yml
```

use ```deploy.sh``` script like [this](ops-depls/template/deploy.sh) to manually upload release.
```deploy.sh``` use bosh cli v2 syntax.

## How to generate a tfvars in json from a yaml template?
You can use spruce embedded with post-generate.sh to do it !
See [post-generate.sh](micro-depls/terraform-config/template/post-generate.sh) script t

### Sample

There is no yet public template sample. Orange employees can have a look to the [post-generate.sh](micro-depls/terraform-config/template/post-generate.sh) in the private paas-template repo.

## How to bootstrap pipelines to a new concourse

simply run [concourse-bootstrap.sh](concourse-bootstrap.sh) with the appropriate environment variable set. It loads the
```bootstrap-all-init-pipelines``` pipeline and triggers it.  


```
SECRETS=<path_to_your_secret_dir> FLY_TARGET=<your_target> ./concourse-bootstrap.sh
```

### pre requisite
The following tools are required to run [concourse-bootstrap.sh](concourse-bootstrap.sh)
 - git 
 - fly, the concourse CLI
    - Login to concourse in main team


## How to create a new root deployment

To setup a new paas-template repo, a new secrets repo or to add a new root deployment, you can run 
[create-root-depls](scripts/create-root-depls.rb) script to create empty files.

### pre requisite
The following tools are required to run [create-root-depls](scripts/create-root-depls.rb)
 - ruby

# Development

## Running the Test Suite

If you are running the full test suite, some of the integration tests are dependent on the fly CLI.


To login to the Fly CLI and target the cf-ops-automation CI:

```sh
fly -t cf-ops-automation login
```

You will be prompted to select either the Github, UAA or Basic Auth authentication methods.

After these are set up, you will be able to run the test suite via:

```sh
bundler exec rspec
```
